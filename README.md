# React Recipeas

Hey there! Welcome to React Recipeas! 

React Recipeas is an application that allows you to make search calls to the Edamam API for their food recipes. Since we're all spending a little more time at home, I couldn't think of a better time to create this! 

### Technologies Used
- React.js
- Javascript
- SASS
- Axios

### Features 
- Search for recipes based on your input

### Limitations
- Since the application is hitting the Free version of Edamam, the application can send a max of 12 calls/min.

### Note
- Currently working on a team project for a non-profit organization. Will get back to this ASAP!
